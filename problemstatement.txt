Problem Statement:

During the annual Samarpana Marathon, organized in honor of the army, participants
are required to register through an online form. However, existing registration forms
often lack proper interactivity, real-time input validation, and a responsive design,
leading to incomplete entries, errors, and reduced user satisfaction. For this marathon, it
is also mandatory for every participant to select a T-shirt size, as wearing the official
Samarpana T-shirt is compulsory for the run. The form must not only validate user
inputs but also provide dynamic feedback, ensure mobile-friendly responsiveness, and
display a reference table of available T-shirt sizes for clarity.

If any required field is empty, an alert must show up asking to fill the required empty
field. Display the date and time while the form is being filled for user convenience.

When the form is submitted, do the following:
1. Check if the “checkbox” is checked.
2. Show a confirmation dialog before submitting the form.
